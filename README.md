# The Gossiper
The program is based on a context-free grammar model that uses recursion to generate potentially infinite embedded clauses. We used this method to create a fun program that generates random gossip-like messages.

## What it does
Running gossiper.html will open the program in a local webpage on the user's default internet browser. The webpage should look like so: ![Whoopsie!](/readmefiles/Picture1.png) The Gossiper is an embedded python script which generates "gossipy" sentences. 

These randomly generated sentences have a general structure: a noun phrase, a verb phrase, and an emoji phrase at the end of the sentence. The randomly selected phrases are then concatenated together to form your gossipy sentence! Press the button for another gossipy sentence!

## Why our project fits the theme of exploring the unknown
It's within human nature to be curious, to question, and desire knowledge. Then it's no surprise it's innate for us to seek to explore and discover the unknown. This can range from physical locations to knowledge. 

Gossip is one of these "unknowns" that almost every student has partook in, whether as the instigator or victim, in junior-high or college. Knowing the events happening to those around you is strangely addicting... This program intends to feed that desire by generating gossip.
