# Gossiper
The program is based on a context-free grammar model that uses recursion to generate potentially infinite embedded clauses. We used this method to create a fun program that generates random gossip-like messages.

## What it does
Running gossiper.html will open the program in a local webpage on the user's default internet browser.
